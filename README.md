# Bikeshare Project

## Description
The project is the 2nd project of the *Programming for Data Science with Python* Nanodegree Program. It contains a python script that analyzes the data of a bikeshare company. The user has the possibility to filter the data by city, month and day of the week. Also it is possible to list raw data.

## Required software
You need a python interpreter and preferably [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed on your computer. Required third-party python libraries to run the script are [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
The bikeshare data is not included in this project and can be downloaded from the udacity project site.

## Credits
The template for the bikeshare python program was provided by udacity.
